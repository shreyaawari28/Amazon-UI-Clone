# Amazon UI Clone (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
**Amazon-UI-Clone** is a **static front-end clone of Amazon’s homepage**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.

This repository contains the **complete Amazon UI layout**, including the navigation bar, secondary menu panel, hero section, product shop sections, and a fully structured multi-level footer.  
The goal of this project is to practice **real-world UI replication**, layout structuring, and styling using **pure HTML and CSS**, without JavaScript.

This is a **UI-focused clone**, not a functional e-commerce application.

## 🧪 How It Works
The UI is divided into structured sections:

- **Header & Navbar**: Uses Flexbox to align navigation elements horizontally.  
- **Panel Section**: Secondary menu bar for quick navigation links.  
- **Hero Section**: Full-width background image with a centered message overlay.  
- **Shop Section**: Product categories displayed as cards using Flexbox and `flex-wrap`.  
- **Footer**: Built in multiple layers, including navigation links, branding, and legal information.

All layout behavior, styling, and positioning are handled entirely using CSS.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Search bar, links, and buttons are non-functional  
- Layout is not responsive for smaller devices  
- Static UI clone created purely for learning purposes  

These limitations are intentional.
